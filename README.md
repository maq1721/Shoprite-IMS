Inventory Management System for Shoprite Ghana created using C#

The file is in the main branch under the name "10836624", with all the resources and code.

This is a simple inventory management system made for shoprite Ghana.

Below are the assumptions made when designing the system

Admin account is assumed to already have been created, with only the admin having access to the user menu box.

Admin can add and delete all users with the exception of the admin account.

Only the admin account has access to the unit menu and can add and delete various units of measurement to the shoprite database.

Only the admin account has access to the product menu and can add products that are in stock, make purchases from vendors and generate a sales report on transactions made.

Only the admin account has access to the dealer menu where they can add, update and delete information on dealers who are doing business with shoprite.

Both admin and employees have access to the purchases report page which is used to print a history of all transactions made.
